# Coursera-Objective-I
Summary:
Create a front-end application 'Lunch Checker' that presents the user with a textbox where they can enter a list of dishes (comma-separated items)to have for lunch.
 Once that's entered, the user has to click on the **"Check If Too Much"** button. 
 
 Note: no use on on-click, none of your variables/objects/functions "leak to the global scope". 
 
 Acceptance Criteria's (optional)
 i) If the message is "Enjoy!" or "Too much!", make the font color green. If the message is "Please enter data first", make the font color red.
ii) If the message is "Enjoy!" or "Too much!", make the border color around the textbox green. If the message is "Please enter data first", make the border color around the textbox red.
iii) Implement this case item 1, item2,,item3 or this case item 1, item2, ,item3 as not counting an 'empty' item towards the count of how many items there are in the list. Please make sure to put a comment somewhere next to the input textbox stating that you do NOT consider an empty item, i.e., , , as an item towards to the count, so whoever is grading your assignment doesn't erroneously mark that as an error.
